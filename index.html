        <p>
            My name is Warley Franco (a little different name), I was born in Rio de Janeiro, raised in a small city called Conceição de Macabu, I fell in love by codes on the first time a saw how they work, and after this I never stopped learn, always thinking about quality and best practices.
        </p>

        <p>
            I've worked in some really nice Brazilian companies like RedZero, Profite, E-Can, Época Cosméticos (Magazine Luiza Group), Bennu S.A. and others, each place I've worked was a great experience and learning who formed my current knowledge and my eye focused to create awesome solutions for business.
        </p>

        <h5>How I work?</h5>
        <p>
            My development process starts on understanding what kind of challenge we need to dive in.
        </p>
        <p>
            After this, we need to design how we want it works.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then we start to create a prototype based on these requirements, just to check if they really solve the challenge
        </p>    

        <h5>What can I create for you?</h5>
        <p>
            Currently I work with static sites, with responsive features, E-commerces (Vtex, Shopify), Hybrid Mobile Apps, and custom systems
        </p>
        <p>
            Technologies: ES6, WebPack, React, React Native, Angular, Ionic, NodeJS.
        </p>
        <p>

            If you need some specific knowledge or technology, please get in touch, I will be glad to learn something new to create a greate solution for you.
